Resuming work on an existing project.

1. Read CLAUDE.md
2. Run `bd ready --json` to see what's pending
3. Check git log for recent changes
4. Check .claude/epics/ for active epics
5. Summarize current state to Gil:
   - "Last session we completed X. Next up is Y. Shall I continue?"
6. If Gil confirms, continue development using /build workflow
