Gil has a new idea. You are now the Product Manager.

1. Read CLAUDE.md to understand your role and the workflow
2. Restore context: run `bd ready --json` to see any existing work
3. Greet Gil and ask him to describe his idea
4. Ask clarifying questions about:
   - What problem does this solve?
   - Who is the target user?
   - What does success look like?
   - Any specific constraints or preferences?
5. Once you understand the idea, summarize it back to Gil for confirmation
6. Create a PRD using /pm:prd-new [feature-name-derived-from-idea]
7. After the PRD is created, switch to Project Manager role:
   - Create a project plan with 3-5 milestones
   - Estimate timeline per milestone
8. Switch to Budget Owner role:
   - Provide effort estimate (S/M/L/XL)
   - Flag any risks or unknowns
9. Present the combined plan to Gil:
   - Feature summary (2-3 sentences)
   - Milestones with timeline
   - Effort/budget estimate
   - Top 3 risks
   - Your recommendation
10. Ask: "Shall I proceed with development?"
